# cmsis_dap_tcp for OpenOCD - Multi-Transport Edition

> **New**: This project now supports **WiFi/TCP, USB CDC, and Bluetooth SPP** simultaneously!

OpenOCD supports the CMSIS-DAP protocol to communicate with a JTAG / SWD
programmer. Typically this is a local programmer with a USB connection. With
the addition of the OpenOCD cmsis_dap_tcp backend, the CMSIS-DAP protocol can
now run over TCP/IP instead of USB. This allows OpenOCD to connect to a remote
programmer over the network.

This project provides the remote-side implementation of the cmsis_dap_tcp
protocol, using an ESP32 as the remote programmer. It allows a cheap ESP32
board to program and debug an ARM microcontroller target via **multiple simultaneous transports**:

- **WiFi/TCP** (Active by default) - Remote debugging over wireless network
- **USB CDC** (Optional) - Plug-and-play USB debugger when docked
- **Bluetooth SPP** (Optional) - Wireless debugging without WiFi infrastructure

## Key Features

- **Multiple Simultaneous Transports**: WiFi/TCP, USB CDC, and Bluetooth SPP can all operate at the same time
- **Tested with** XIAO ESP32C6 and ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 development boards as the programmer, and STM32F103 Blue Pill and Nucleo STM32F401RE as the targets
- **Both JTAG and SWD modes** supported. 2 GPIO needed for SWD, minimum 4 GPIO for JTAG
- An optional GPIO pin can be used to drive the NRST# (SRST) signal, but this
  is typically not required.
- In JTAG mode, an optional GPIO pin can be used to drive the TRST signal, but
  this is typically not required.
- A separate GPIO may be used to control an activity LED.
- UART to TCP/IP bridge can be enabled to provide access to the target board's
  serial console remotely, using an ESP32 UART.
- **Transport Configuration**: Edit `sdkconfig` or run `idf.py menuconfig` to:
  - Set WiFi credentials for TCP mode
  - Enable USB CDC transport (when TinyUSB available)
  - Enable Bluetooth SPP transport (when Bluedroid available)
  - Configure GPIO pin assignments
- **Typical performance**:
  - Reading / writing SRAM: up to 200 KB/sec
  - Flashing a 512 KB firmware image to the STM32F401RE
  completes in about 13.4 seconds, including erase, program, and verify (with 4
  to 8 seconds of that time used for flash erasure). The Blue Pill takes about
  6 seconds for a 64KB image.
  - Performance depends on the quality of your WiFi network.

The CMSIS-DAP code came from the Firmware directory of the [CMSIS-DAP
repo](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-DAP). ```DAP_config.h``` was then
modified to support the ESP32 GPIO.
```
commit 1fd47bed772ea40923472c90dfe11516e76033ee (HEAD -> main, tag: v2.1.2, origin/main, origin/HEAD)
```

## Quick Start

1. **Select your board**:
   ```bash
   # For XIAO ESP32-C6
   cp sdkconfig.xiao_esp32c6 sdkconfig
   
   # For ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1
   cp sdkconfig.esp32s3_devkitc_1 sdkconfig
   ```

2. **Configure settings** (optional):
   ```bash
   idf.py menuconfig
   # Set WiFi SSID/password
   # Enable/disable transports (USB, Bluetooth)
   # Configure GPIO pins
   ```

3. **Build and flash**:
   ```bash
   idf.py build
   idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash
   idf.py monitor  # See WiFi connection and TCP server startup
   ```

4. **Connect with OpenOCD**:
   ```bash
   openocd -f tcl/interface/cmsis_dap_tcp.cfg \
           -f tcl/target/stm32f1x.cfg
   ```

For detailed configuration and usage, see [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md).

# Limitations

The software has some limitations:

- SWO is currently unsupported.
- Maximum clock rate is about 1000 KHz (ESP32C6 configured for 160 MHz / 80 MHz).
- The WiFi credentials are hardcoded. The software must be rebuilt if you want
  to change them.

# Building and Flashing the Firmware

This code requires the ESP-IDF build tools. Refer to the official
[installation guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/index.html#installation)
and install them first.

Activate your ESP-IDF virtual environment:

```
. $HOME/esp/esp-idf/export.sh
```

The code supports multiple different boards, and each one has its own
```sdkconfig``` file.

Choose the correct ```sdkconfig.<board_name>``` file for your board and copy it
to ```sdkconfig```. Then configure, build and flash the firmware. For example,
for the Xiao ESP32-C6 board:

```
cp sdkconfig.xiao_esp32c6 sdkconfig
idf.py fullclean menuconfig
idf.py build flash
```

In menuconfig, goto to the "CMSIS-DAP configuration" page.

* Your WiFi SSID and password can be configured on the "WiFi configuration"
  subpage.  (If you are not using WPA2, you might need to adjust the WiFi Scan
  auth mode threshold).

  <img src="img/menuconfig1.png" width="75%" />
  <br><br>
  <img src="img/menuconfig2.png" width="75%" />

* If needed, you can change the GPIO port pins for JTAG, SWD, reset, and LED on
  the "GPIO number assignments" subpage. The signals can be disabled if they are
  not needed.

  <img src="img/menuconfig3.png" width="75%" />

* If you want to use the UART to TCP/IP bridge, it can be configured on the
  the "UART to TCP/IP bridge" subpage. (Currently, the baud rate and other
  settings cannot be changed at runtime). A script ```host/uart_bridge.sh```
  is provided that uses ```socat``` to present the remote UART as a pseudo-tty
  that can be opened using any serial terminal program on the host.

# Building and Running OpenOCD

Get the latest source code from git. Configure and build it as usual:

```
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/openocd/code openocd
cd openocd
./bootstrap
./configure
make
```

An OpenOCD configuration file has been provided for convenience.
Edit your ```tcl/interface/cmsis_dap_tcp.cfg``` configuration file to point to
your ESP32's IP address:

```
adapter driver cmsis-dap
cmsis-dap backend tcp
cmsis-dap tcp host 192.168.1.107
cmsis-dap tcp port 4441
transport select swd
reset_config none
```

If you are on a slow WiFi network, you might need to add this line to avoid
short timeouts that can lead to command mismatch errors in some cases. If so,
specify a longer timeout in milliseconds:

```
cmsis-dap tcp min_timeout 300
```

To flash an STM32 target, for example, run the following command from your
OpenOCD build directory.  Replace ```firmware.elf``` with the name of your
ELF file, and ```stm32f1x.cfg``` with the appropriate file for your
microcontroller.

```
./src/openocd --search tcl \
              -f tcl/interface/cmsis-dap-tcp.cfg \
              -f tcl/target/stm32f1x.cfg \
              -c "program firmware.elf verify reset exit"
```

# Operation

After power-on, the ESP32 will attempt to connect to the WiFi that was
configured using menuconfig. It will then begin listening for an incoming
connection from OpenOCD. The ESP32 will print status and error messages to the
console, including the WiFi connection status and IP address. A message is
printed whenever the OpenOCD client connects or disconnects. (Only one active
client is allowed).

You can run the serial monitor to view the console output. To exit the serial
monitor use ```Ctrl+]```.

```
idf.py monitor
```

Once the ESP32 has connected to WiFi and obtained an IP address by DHCP, you
can then run OpenOCD. You should see something like this from the ESP32:

```

```

Additional debugging messages may be enabled by editing
```main/cmsis_dap_tcp.h``` and uncommenting the following line. This will
impact performance.

```
#define DEBUG_PRINTING
```

# Performance

A single SWD 32-bit transfer completes in about 45 microseconds, with an
SWCLK clock rate of approximately 1 MHz. Yellow is SWCLK. Green is SWDIO.

(TODO: the scope available at the time to make these measurements was very
limited. Redo these measurements with a better scope).

Actual performance will depend on your WiFi network. For slow networks,
you might need to increase the ```cmsis-dap tcp min_timeout``` parameter if
you see error messages related to command mismatch.

Starting the OpenOCD server like this:

```
./src/openocd \
    --search tcl \
    -c "debug_level 2" \
    -c "adapter driver cmsis-dap" \
    -c "transport select swd" \
    -c "cmsis-dap backend tcp" \
    -c "cmsis-dap tcp host 192.168.1.107" \
    -c "cmsis-dap tcp port 4441" \
    -c "cmsis-dap tcp min_timeout 150" \
    -f "tcl/target/stm32f4x.cfg" \
    -c "reset_config none"

## Using ESP32-C6 @ 160 MHz

Xiao ESP32C6 running at 160 MHz is the programmer board. Connecting to an
STM32F401RE target and reading and writing SRAM:

```
% telnet localhost 4444
> poll off

> load_image ./random_96kb.bin 0x20000000
98304 bytes written at address 0x20000000
downloaded 98304 bytes in 1.092678s (87.858 KiB/s)

> dump_image /dev/null 0x20000000 0x18000
dumped 98304 bytes in 1.469766s (65.317 KiB/s)
```

Programming and verifying a 512 KB flash image takes about 20 seconds:

```
time ./src/openocd \
    --search tcl \
    -c "debug_level 2" \
    -c "adapter driver cmsis-dap" \
    -c "transport select swd" \

## Using ESP32-S3 @ 240 MHz

Performance is higher on ESP32-S3. The throughput seems more variable
on each run, but here are some representative numbers for writing and
reading SRAM:

```
% telnet localhost 4444
> poll off

> load_image ./random_96kb.bin 0x20000000
98304 bytes written at address 0x20000000
downloaded 98304 bytes in 0.489488s (196.123 KiB/s)

> dump_image /dev/null 0x20000000 0x18000
dumped 98304 bytes in 0.832846s (115.267 KiB/s)
```
